Link to Website: https://alimyust.github.io/SpaceApps2024_Final/
## Overview
This website offers an interactive path to enhance users' knowledge of exoplanets. While there is abundant information available online, not all learners can easily retain knowledge from complex videos or lengthy articles. The goal of this site is to provide a high-level overview, introducing these concepts to newer learners in a less intimidating way.

## Key Features
- **Visual Learning**: Many users are visual learners, so the website's opening screen showcases hand-drawn, original artwork depicting what the surface of each exoplanet might look like. 
- **3D Models**: After selecting an illustration, users are directed to a second screen where they can interact with a 3D model of the exoplanet. These models provide a hypothetical visual representation of what the planet could look like.
- **Fact Sheets**: Each 3D model is accompanied by a fact sheet, which users can toggle to learn key details about the exoplanet, including:
  - How the planet was discovered
  - Its distance from Earth
  - Other interesting facts
- **Additional Resources**: Links to NASA sources are provided for users interested in deeper exploration of the topic.
  
## Mini-Game
A quiz-style mini-game was underdevelopment for users to test their retention of the knowledge they've gained. This feature is designed to reinforce learning through active recall, helping users cement the information in their minds. Although the game could not be fully integrated into the site due to time limitations, it is a fun and repeatable activity that makes the learning process more enjoyable. It is also included into the repository as a zip file containing all of the React code.

## Chatbot (Orbit)
To further enhance the user experience, a chatbot named "Orbit" is available to guide users and answer any questions they may have while exploring the site.

## Conclusion
Team OrBit has created an engaging and educational virtual experience for space enthusiasts of all ages to learn about exoplanets. The website's design introduces users to these fascinating new worlds through a variety of activities, tailored to different learning styles. By offering visual artwork, 3D models, informative fact sheets, and an interactive mini-game, the site makes learning about exoplanets both accessible and enjoyable.
